# EquityScreener

Basic equity screener that utilizes yahoo finance API to pull equity metrics and display them to users. Essentially, the user writes in the ticker symbol of the company they want a report for along with the current date, and they will be presented with a report of the company in question along with a corresponding general description, ratios, company financials, and revenue projections based on historical numbers. Written in Python on Jupyter Notebook.

Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib libraries
